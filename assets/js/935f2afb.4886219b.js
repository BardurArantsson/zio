So instead of acquiring and releasing dependencies for each test, we can share the layer within all tests. The test framework acquires that layer for once and shares that between all tests. When the execution of all tests is finished, that layer will be released. To share layers between multiple specs we can use one of the provide methods ending with Shared (provideShared/provideCustomShared/provideSomeShared/provideLayerShared/provideCustomLayerShared/provideSomeLayerShared):","sidebar":"reference-sidebar"},"reference/test/spec":{"id":"reference/test/spec","title":"Spec","description":"Constructors","sidebar":"reference-sidebar"},"reference/test/test-hierarchies-and-organization":{"id":"reference/test/test-hierarchies-and-organization","title":"Test Hierarchies and Organization","description":"A Spec[R, E] is the backbone of ZIO Test.
