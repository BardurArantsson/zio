The Scala compiler can catch a lot of errors at compile time since it is type-safe. This ensures that our code is mostly correct, and it prevents lots of bugs from creeping into the runtime. So having a type-safe editor that highlights errors will improve our development experience. VSCode with the power of the Metals extension provides us with a type-safe editor for writing Scala programs.","sidebar":"guides-sidebar"},"overview/overview_background":{"id":"overview/overview_background","title":"Background","description":"Procedural Scala programs use procedural functions, which are:","sidebar":"overview_sidebar"},"overview/overview_basic_concurrency":{"id":"overview/overview_basic_concurrency","title":"Basic Concurrency","description":"ZIO has low-level support for concurrency using fibers.
